Welcome to the LMMS samples repository. Here you can commit your own samples for review by the managers for inclusion in either the library or as a separate pack.

### Commit rules:

#### Legal rules:

* The samples you commit must be [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). 

* The samples must be created/recorded by you. They can not be taken from any other sample library or pack. The only exception to this rule is if you have a valid way to prove they are CC0.

#### Technical rules:

* The samples must be in the [FLAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC) [audio file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_file_format) with an [audio bit depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_bit_depth) of 16-bit, preferably at a [sampling rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)#Sampling_rate) of [44100 Hz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/44,100_Hz).

* The samples must be in [mono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaural) files, unless they contain stereo signals.

* The samples must be normalized to -3 [dBFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBFS).

* The samples must not contain unnecessary delay or start/end silence.

* The samples must contain the least amount possible of unwanted [noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise), [aliasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing/), pops or clicks.

* The smaples must be without added [reverberation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverberation) or [delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)) effects unless these effects are necessary for them.

#### Organizing & naming rules:

* The samples must be put in the the folder that best describes them. If your samples don't belong to one of the existing folders or you are not sure where to put them, please put them in the `Unsorted samples` folder.

* The samples' filenames must follow the following naming rules:

1. The filenames must be in English.

2. The filenames must only use letters and numbers.

3. Capitalizing the first letter of each word in the filenames.

4. If the samples are tuned and have defined [pitches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)), put their pitch at the end of their filenames between square brackets like this: `Acoustic guitar [A4]`.

5. If the samples are loops and have defined [tempos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo), put their tempos at the end of their filenames between square brackets like this: `Drum loop [120 bpm]`.

Note: If the samples have defined pitches and tempo, put their pitches before their tempos like this: `Acoustic guitar [A4, 120 bpm]`.

6. If you have multiple related samples and you want to version them, put their number at the end of their filenames after a space.
If the number of a sample is less than 10, add an initial '0' like this: 'Sample 01' and 'Sample 02'.

7. The filenames must be neat and decriptive.

*An example of bad naming: `bEST-sOUND-eVER!_1 A4`.*

*An example of good naming: `Acoustic guitar 01 [A4]`.*

### Definitions:
`Sample library`: These samples are included in the default installation of LMMS.

`Sample packs`: These resource packs will be available for download on the LMMS website, once finished. ~~(http://lmms.io/download/samples)~~ (The page is inactive at the moment).

#### Which one should I choose?
If you have a large amount of samples, you will be better off commiting them as a `sample pack`. The `library`'s purpose is to have a small set of good quality samples to get users started.
