Welcome to the LMMS samples repository. Here you can commit your own samples for review by the managers for inclusion in either the library or as a separate pack.

### Commit rules:

• The samples you commit must be [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). We can however give you credit (your name and email) in the about area of LMMS if you please.

• These samples must be created/recorded by you. They can not be taken from any other sample pack or library. The only exception to this rule is if you have a valid way to prove they are CC0.

• The samples must be in FLAC 16-bit file format.

• The samples must be normalized to -3dBFS.

• The samples mustn't contain unnecessary delay or start/end silence.

• The samples mustn't contain noise, aliasing, pops or clicks.

• The samples must be dry (without reverberation).

• The samples must be put in the the folder that best describes them. If your samples don't belong to one of the existing folders or you are not sure where to put them, please put them in the "Unsorted samples" folder.

• The filenames of the samples must follow the following naming rules:

(1) The name must be in English.

(2) The name should only use letters and numbers.

(3) Capitalizing the first letter of the first word only.

(4) The name must be clean and decriptive.

An example of bad naming: best-Sound-Ever_1

An example of good naming: Bass drum 1

### Definitions:
`Sample library:` These samples are included in the default installation of LMMS. 

`Sample packs:` These resource packs will be available for download on the LMMS website, once finished. ~~(http://lmms.io/download/samples)~~ (page inactive at the moment)

#### Which one should I choose?
If you have a large amount of samples, you will be better off commiting them as a `sample pack`. The `library`'s purpose is to have a small set of good quality samples to get users started.
