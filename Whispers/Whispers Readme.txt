This is a collection of sounds made with Novation Mininova synth. 
These are meant to be opened with AudioFileProcessor.


The sounds:
There are 3 different kinds of whispers divided in 15 keys. I disrtibuted the whispers in a way so you just need to fix them max 2 tones up or down to get the needed whisper at the needed key. This is it:
C5 - First kind
D5 - Second kind
E5 - Third kind
F5 - First kind
G5 - Second kind
A6 - Third kind
B6 - First kind
C6 - Second kind
D6 - Third kind
E6 - First kind
F6 - Second kind
G6 - Third kind
A7 - First kind
B7 - Second kind
C7 - Third kind

So if you want, for example, D6 second kind, you just have to take C6 and play it a tone up.
Of course if you want a flat or a sharp key you'll have to play the nearest sound a semitone up or down.

Don't forget to try one of them reversed and 2 to 4 octaves deeper!


Kinds of whispers:
First kind: a simple hit saying letter "T"
Second kind: a soft breathe
Third kind: a softer "T" and a "D" as an echo
