The samples in this folder make up the sample library which, when complete, will be included in the default installation of LMMS. Please follow the rules below when contributing to the library.

### Legal rules

* Samples must be [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) (dedicated to the public domain).
* Samples must be created/recorded by you. They can not be taken from any other sample library or pack. The only exception to this rule is if you have a valid way to prove they are CC0.

### Miscellaneous rules

The following sample types are sorted by descending priority.
  1. Drums/Percussion
  2. Foley/SFX
  3. Vocals
  4. Loops
  5. Notes/Chords

### Audio rules

* Samples must be in the FLAC audio file format with a sampling rate of 44100 Hz.
* Samples must be in mono files unless they contain stereo signals.
* Samples that contain stereo signals must be mid-panned.
* Samples must be peak-normalized to -3 dBFS.
* Samples must not contain unnecessary start/end silence.
* Samples should contain the least amount possible of noise.
* Samples should not contain unnecessary reverb or echos.

### File and folder rules

* Metadata tags must be empty.
* Filenames must be in English and words must start with a capital letter.
* Filenames should be descriptive but not too long.
* If a sample is tuned, put its pitch at the end of the filename after a hyphen, like this: `Acoustic Guitar - A#4`.
* If a sample is a loop, put its tempo at the end of the filename after a hyphen, like this: `Swingy Drum Loop - 120 BPM`.
* If you have related samples, sort them by putting numbers, starting with 1, at the end of their filenames, like this: `Muffled Impact 1`.
* Samples should be put in the folders that best describe them. If your samples do not belong to any of the existing folders, or if you are not sure where to put them, please put them in the `Unsorted samples` folder.
