Welcome to the LMMS samples folder. Here you can commit your samples for review by the managers for inclusion in either the library or as a separate pack.

### Commit rules:

#### Legal rules:

* The samples you commit must be [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

* The samples must be created/recorded by you. They can not be taken from any other sample library or pack. The only exception to this rule is if you have a valid way to prove they are CC0.

#### Technical rules:

* The samples must be in the [FLAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC) [audio file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_file_format) with an [audio bit depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_bit_depth) of 24-bit.

* The samples must be in [mono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaural) files, unless they contain [stereo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereophonic_sound) signals.

* The samples must be [peak normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_normalization#Peak_normalization) to -3 [dBFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBFS).

* The samples must not contain unnecessary delay or start/end silence.

* The samples must contain the least amount possible of unwanted [noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise), [aliasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing/), pops or clicks.

* The samples must be without added [reverberation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverberation) or [delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)) effects unless these effects are necessary for them.

#### Naming and organizing rules:

* The samples' filenames must follow the following naming rules:

1. The filenames must be in English.

2. Capitalizing the first letter of each word in the filenames.

3. If the samples are tuned and have defined [pitches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)), put their pitches at the end of their filenames between square brackets like this: `Acoustic Guitar [A4]`.

4. If the samples are loops and have defined [tempos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo), put their tempos at the end of their filenames between square brackets like this: `Drum Loop [120 bpm]`.

Note: If the samples have defined pitches and tempos, put their pitches before their tempos like this: `Acoustic Guitar Melody [A4, 120 bpm]`.

5. If you have multiple related samples and you want to version them, put their numbers at the end of their filenames after a space.

6. The filenames must be descriptive and neat.

*An example of bad naming: `bEST-sOUND-eVER!_1 A4`.*

*An example of good naming: `Acoustic Guitar 1 [A4]`.*

* The samples must be put in the folders that best describe them. If your samples don't belong to one of the existing folders or you are not sure where to put them, please put them in the `Unsorted samples` folder.

#### Metadata tags:

The samples' metadata tags must be empty.

### Definitions:
`Sample library`: These samples are included in the default installation of LMMS.

`Sample packs`: These resource packs will be available for download on the LMMS website, once finished. ~~(http://lmms.io/download/samples)~~ (The page is inactive at the moment).

#### Which one should I choose?
If you have a large amount of samples, you will be better off commiting them as a `sample pack`. The `library`'s purpose is to have a small set of good quality samples to get users started.
