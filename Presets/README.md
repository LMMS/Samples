The presets in this folder are additions to the preset library included in the default installation of LMMS. Please follow the rules below when contributing to the library.

### Legal rules

* Presets must be [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) (dedicated to the public domain).
* Presets must be created by you. They can not be taken from any other preset library or pack. The only exception to this rule is if you have a valid way to prove they are CC0.

### Technical rules

* Presets should contain the least amount possible of noise.
* Keep the overall volume at a reasonable level; not too quiet/loud.
* Keep unused parameters at their default values.

### Naming and organizing rules

* Preset names and filenames must be in English and words must start with a capital letter.
* If you have related presets, sort them by putting numbers, starting with 1, at the end of their names, like this: `Robot Sneeze 1`.
* Presets must be put in their suitable folders.

### Note on post processing

Do not drown the instrument in effects, let it shine!
