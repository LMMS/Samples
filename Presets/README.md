Welcome to the LMMS presets folder. Here you can commit your presets for review by the managers for inclusion in the library.

### Commit rules:

#### Legal rules:

* The presets you commit must be [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

* The presets must be created by you. They can not be taken from any other preset library or pack. The only exception to this rule is if you have a valid way to prove they are CC0.

#### Technical rules:

* The presets must not have unnecessary delay or start/end silence.

* The presets must not have [DC offset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_bias). If a preset generates audio with DC offset, use the `DC Offset Remover` effect to remove it.

* The presets must have the least amount possible of unwanted [noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise), [aliasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing/), pops or clicks.

* The presets must be without added [reverberation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverberation) or [delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)) effects unless these effects are necessary for them.

* Unused parameters must stay at their default values. 

* Get the best out of instrument plugins with the least amount possible of effect plugins.

#### Naming and organizing rules:

* The presets' names & filenames must follow the following naming rules:

1. The names & filenames must be in English.

2. Capitalizing the first letter of each word in the names & filenames.

3. If you have multiple related presets and you want to version them, put their numbers at the end of their names & filenames after a space.

4. The names & filenames must be descriptive and neat.

An example of bad naming: `bEST-pRESETU-eVER!_1`.

An example of good naming: `Supersaw 1`.

* The presets must be put in their instrument or effect folder.
